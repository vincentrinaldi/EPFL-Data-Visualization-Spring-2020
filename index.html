In October 1848, the Cambridge Rules were a first attempt to unify the football rules. While the first independent clubs appeared in the 1860s, first international football match took place during the 1870s.

Football will not be the same after his genius has been expressed.

                        The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) was founded in 1954 in Basel. Its role is to manage and develop football at continental level under the supervision of the FIFA. In 1960, the European Football Championship was created, and it is still the second most important competition today. With this new competition and the establishment of a continental club cup, Europe became once again the most prominent region in football world and began to attract South American superstars in the early 1970s.

            Modern Football
        </h3>
        <p>
            The start of the new millennium marks the definitive internationalisation of football, with few Brazilian or Argentinian players staying to play in their own countries. Money is playing a big part in these movements: European football now has a lot of funds at its disposal, such as Zidane's €75m transfer in 2001. Furthermore, <b>3,000 more international matches have been played compared to the last decade</b>. <b>In 10 years, almost 9,000 matches are held</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2002 and for the first time in the history of the World Cup, two countries, <b>South Korea and Japan, co-hosted the event</b>. South Korea shone through to the semi-finals, becoming the first Asian nation to reach this level. <b>Brazil beat Germany 2-0 in the final</b>, thanks to their new striker Ronaldo, who scored 8 goals in the tournament.
        </p>
        <p>
            Brazil team still impressed with its international stars, such as Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Kaka and Roberto Carlos, but was stopped by the ageing but still talented France team. This 2006 edition is marked by Zidane's expulsion in the final, which left the <b>Italians to win</b> after a thrilling penalty session.
